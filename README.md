This is a full-stack website that allows users to create and store recipes that allow other users to gain access to. The goal of the project was to create an intuitive way to create recipes for others to view and learn about the nutritional benefits of said recipes/

 A user can upload their recipes by adding ingredients as well as the measurements of each ingredient if they wish to include it.
 By default, all users are greeted with a page of all different user's recipes, but a user can look at explicitly their own created recipes by clicking the {user's} recipes in the top right corner.

 This project utilizes User Authentication to allow different users to create recipes of their own and access them in the near future for references.
